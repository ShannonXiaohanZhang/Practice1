Pros: 
* Design is organized and easy to understand 
* All the basic requirements are met 
* Variable names are descriptive and it’s easy to tell what they represent 

Cons: 
* Arrows for “create cryptogram” and “create player” should go in other direction 
* Some variable names are very long 
* Operations are lacking arguments 
* The Create relationship between Administrator and Cryptogram, and between Administrator and Player would better be association rather than dependency 
* The editing cryptogram functions of Administrator is not shown in this design 
* The difference in the viewTheListOfPleayerStatistic methods of Player and Administrator is not shown in this design 
* Two methods in the Player class might be better in SolveCryptogram class (submitSolution and guessSolution)
